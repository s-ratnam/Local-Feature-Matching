# Local-Feature-Matching
The goal of this project is to create a local feature matching algorithm using techniques described in Szeliski chapter 4.1. The pipeline we suggest is based on a simplified version of the famous SIFT pipeline. However, we will not be implementing this in the classical fashion. We will be implementing it as though it were part of a neural network. The matching pipeline is intended to work for instance-level matching â€“ multiple views of the same physical scene.
